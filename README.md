Unity Game For Testing the Gauntl33t Haptic Glove.

Changes from the demo at events 
- Had to remove the catana because even though it is free on asset store I am not sure if it is alright to share on Github. Hopefully will make a replacement at some point.
- Also, removed the copyright infringing music that I had on the demo.
- The art on the wall is now replaced with an AI generated picture but you might get the vague reference.  If anyone wants to make a replacement art would be appreciated.

Would love to eventually make this into a full globe trotting archeologist action adventure game which starts in a club sort of like a certain famous movie with an archeologist as the main character.

It looks like I used the XR Interaction Toolkit for actual VR Integration:

I believe I used the Steam VR Hand for the hand model. So credit to them for the hands:

Any help with making this demo / game better would be greatly appreciated!
